\section{Goron}

\subsection{Physiology}
Gorons stand taller and wider than hylians, and universally have skin of an orange-brown hue. What little "hair" they possess is so stiff and thick it resembles solid rock, and usually grows only high on a goron's scalp and across its upper back. A few gorons are also able to grow beards or other facial hair, especially if they are of advanced age. A pair of goron eyes are wide set, perfectly circular, and completely dark—posessing no whites like those of a hylian's or gerudo's eyes. Goron noses are flat. Jaws are very wide, powerful, and composed entirely of molars—used to crush and pulverize the rocks which famously make up goron diets.\\
Although they are physiologically more similar to earth elementals than mammals, gorons nonetheless take a humanoid shape. They are required to eat and sleep to live. Drinking serves no purpose for them. They can persist indefinitely without breathing, but doing so is unpleasant, especially when the goron is exerting itself. Mysteriously, gorons dine on rocks and other solid minerals—tastes vary between tribes, as some prefer coarse ores, others savor gemstones, but they generally dislike less solid earth such as sand or dirt. A few dine on more traditional foods such as meat or mushrooms, but this seems to be for pleasure rather than sustenance.\\
Because they are literally made of rock, gorons have an inherent durability to their bodies, but are also particularly dense and heavy. This makes traditional movement difficult for them over anything but short distances. When traveling more than a few feet, a goron will usually tuck itself into a ball and roll, which allows it to traverse ground at much greater speed. This speed of this "goron roll" combined with a goron's weight makes it a powerful charging attack for chasing down foes. Aside from this, gorons battle with powerful punches—punches so powerful that fighting unarmed is the norm among their race.\\
Gorons only possess one apparent sex, which they universally refer to as male. "Brother" is a very common term of endearment among them, and friends of a goron tribe are often referred to as brothers—regardless of whether or not they are male.

\subsection{Society}
Goron cities and villages are almost universally built into caves or the sides of mountains, where the tastiest and most nutritious rocks are abundant. Their reliance on 
\includegraphics{darunia.jpg} \\
eating rocks makes their cultures particularly dependent on mining to survive, to the extent that the majority of gorons have experience in this profession. Many anthropologists believe gorons evolved to be as physically powerful and enduring as they are due to their race's inherent dependency on mining. Stronger gorons with greater strength made better miners, which enabled them to better survive and provide for their kin.\\
Due to their mining dependency, goron culture heavily involves stonework and the working of metals. Blacksmiths are abundant among them, and their structures are constructed almost entirely of metal. They're also one of few races that has widely adapted the use of blackpowder, and when in battle they often make use of bombs or other explosives. Their resistance to heat gives them an edge over most foes when using such powerful, but esoteric weapons.\\
Gorons almost always place a high degree of value on physical strength and stamina, pride, honesty, and trustworthiness. Gorons most readily get along with races which share these values, usually including the like of subrosians, rito, and most hylians. A friend is rarely lost on a goron unless that friend is caught in a lie. Unsurprisingly, gorons often have a difficult time with people from less prideful cultures.

\subsection{Goron Names}
Goron names are all considered male. These names more often than not consist of at least one "go" or "da" syllable. Deep vowel sounds such as "ah," "oh," and "oo" are prominent. "R" consonants are also very common, especially in the center of the name. \\

\subsection{Goron Traits}
Built like mountains, eating rocks, and wading through lava — gorons are nothing if not hardy and impregnable.

This dice changes as you level up, as shown in the Roll Attack table.

\section{Zora}

\subsection{Physiology}

Amphibious, fish-like humanoids, zora have sleek and glistening bodies. Zora rarely breed, but when they do, they have offspring in batches of eggs ranging from 1 to 8, which grow into tadpoles, and eventually amphibious humanoids. Zora age at a slow rate compared to hylians, but have a growth spurt and reach adulthood around the age of 20, reach middle age at about 100 years, and can occasionally live to be more than 200.
The exact shape and demeanor of zora is heavily dependent on the two subraces: sea zora, and river zora. "Sea zora" have evolved to live in deeper saltwater, and "river zora" have evolved to live in shallower freshwater, but modern zora of either variety can be found in either habitat.\\
Sea zora are taller and more slender, and have a pale white chest and face, with a backside of a darker color—usually blue, but occasionally red, gray, brown, or other colors. The shape of a sea zora's head varies widely, but usually has a backside resembling some variety of fish tail, with fins that further aid its ability to swim.\\
River zora are squatter and wider, though still slightly larger than hylians on average. Their scales are a blush-green color that blends well into seaweed and shallow rivers, but their heads feature orange fins and lips.

\subsection{Society}

Due to their amphibious nature, zora villages are most often built along coastlines, rivers, lakes, and other areas that blend shallow water with nearby land. This enables them to effectively evade and defend against predators that are exclusive to land or sea, and hunt more effectively from both sources. Zora usually wear a small amount of jewelry or armor, but less clothing than races such as hylians or rito, as excess clothing hampers their ability to swim.\\
A given zora tribe is usually ruled by a royal family of zora, to which the tribe is loyal for generations. The current monarch of a tribe is often referred to with a title such as "King Zora" or "Queen Zora" than his or her actual name.\\
River zora are more hostile to outside races, including sea zora. They have an instinctive desire to aggressively defend what waters they call their own, and will attack any foreign entities with blasts of fire without hesitation. The rare outsider who can gain the trust of a river zora tribe will find they are not murderers nor thieves, but are in fact quite friendly to their allies.\\
Sea zora are comparatively more accepting, and their royal families are usually allies with the royal families of hylians. They frequently intermingle with other races who live on coastlines, and are renowned for their unique \\

style of music.
